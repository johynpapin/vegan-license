## Vegan Clause

You are a vegan developer? You don't want your code to be used for cruel projects? Just add the vegan clause to your license to prevent these uses.

```
Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

This source code cannot be used in projects that do not respect this definition of veganism.

A vegan license is a license that contains this clause. If you remix, transform, or build upon the source code, you must distribute your contributions under a vegan license.
